One hand of Blackjack using client-side Javascript and DOM manipulation.

On the initial screen, the user can enter a series of comma separated face values (2 - 10, J, Q, K, A) that will set the cards of the top of the deck to those values
Consequently, if a user puts in 2,3,4,5 â€¦. 2 will be on the top of the deck, 3 next, etc.
So when hands are dealt, the computer will be dealt a 2 and a 4, and the player will be dealt a 3 and a 5
